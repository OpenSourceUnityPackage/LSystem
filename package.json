  "description": "An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a tool for creating a grammatical sequence based on rules. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to create strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into a larger string of symbols, an initial \"axiom\" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. This sequence can be used later by a reader for procedural generation purposes.",
